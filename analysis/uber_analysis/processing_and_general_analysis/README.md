## ‚ö†Ô∏è Outliers

<img src="images/boxplot.png" alt="Box-plot" width="700">

| Column        | Outliers | % Outliers |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| booking_value | 3,435    | 2.3%       |
| avg_vtat      | 0        | 0.0%       |
| avg_ctat      | 0        | 0.0%       |
| ride_distance | 0        | 0.0%       |

**Note:** Outliers are preserved since they reflect **real booking behavior**.

## üîç Why Not Drop Missing Values or Outliers?

- **Missing Values:** Some NULLs indicate meaningful scenarios (e.g., no cancellation, no rating), dropping them would remove valuable context.
- **Outliers:** These often represent genuine high- or low-value rides and are important for analysis.
